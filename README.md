# Updated RFID GNU Radio Code

This is a set of RFID codes for GNU Radio, which is based on the original work done at [nkargas/Gen2-UHF-RFID-Reader](https://github.com/nkargas/Gen2-UHF-RFID-Reader). The original codebase was built around older versions of Python, GNU Radio, and UHD. However, as these older versions have since been deprecated, this updated version has been adapted to be compatible with the newer versions of these tools.

## Tested Environment

The code has been tested and confirmed to work with the following software versions:

- Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS
- Python 3.8.10
- GNU Radio 3.8.5.0
- UHD 4.4.0

## YAML Files

The YAML files have been redesigned and can now be utilized within GNU Radio flowgraph.
